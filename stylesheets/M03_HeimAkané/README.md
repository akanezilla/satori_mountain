#How to play:
- use UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT to move around the map
- press SELECT to open the chest and BUTTON A to collect the armor
- enter the spring by following the petals and entering the pond with either 3 stamina orbs collected or 1 orb and the armor
- be colliding with the LotM in the actual trial and press BUTTON SELECT to fill the stamina wheel before time runs out

#Things I added:
- finalized maps for the actual trial
- added logic for absorbing armor and changed sprite to reflect that
- finalized stamina sprites, armor sprite, armored link, stamina wheel, blupees, and the countdown numbers
- added final game logic
- added stipulations for entering the trial (collecting stamina/armor)
- looping music (town) and non-looping (collecting the armor)
- palette modification when non-armored Link collects spirit orbs

#Things to add:
- LotM sprite, start/pause/win/lose final art
- better collision map
- priority for sprites
- maybe korok seeds for extra fun


#Buggy things:
- sometimes a blupee will not deactivate when the spring trial starts
- the start/pause states will be moved around (as if following hoff/voff once game is started)
